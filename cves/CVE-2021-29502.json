A vulnerability has been found in the code that allows any user to access sensible informations by setting up a specific template which is not properly sanitized. The problem has been patched in version 1.3.18. Users should update and type `!warnsysteminfo` to check that their version is 1.3.18 or above. As a workaround users may unload the WarnSystem cog or disable the `!warnset description` command globally."], "published": "2021-05-10T18:15:07.833", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["retke"], "productName": ["Laggrons-Dumb-Cogs"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/retke/Laggrons-Dumb-Cogs/security/advisories/GHSA-834g-67vv-m9wq"], "commits": ["https://github.com/retke/Laggrons-Dumb-Cogs/commit/c79dd2cc879989cf2018e76ba2aad0baef3b4ec8"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/retke/Laggrons-Dumb-Cogs/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 744364, "Makefile": 1293}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23153234?v=4", "stargazers": 53, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
