Versions of v8n prior to 1.5.1 were found to have an inefficient regular expression complexity in the `lowercase()` and `uppercase()` regex which could lead to a denial of service attack. In testing of the `lowercase()` function a payload of 'a' + 'a'.repeat(i) + 'A' with 32 leading characters took 29443 ms to execute. The same issue happens with uppercase(). Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."], "published": "2022-08-02T20:15:09.947", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["imbrn"], "productName": ["v8n"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/imbrn/v8n/security/advisories/GHSA-xrx9-gj26-5wx9"], "commits": ["https://github.com/imbrn/v8n/commit/92393862156fad190c05ec3f6e2bc73308dcd2f9"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/imbrn/v8n/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["javascript", "library", "validation"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 66651, "TypeScript": 1127, "Shell": 328}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1906977?v=4", "stargazers": 4171, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
