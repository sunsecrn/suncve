This allows unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary remote code on the server, provided that allow_url_include is enabled. Local File Inclusion is also possible, albeit less useful because it requires that the attacker be able to upload a malicious php file via FTP or some other means into a directory readable by the web server."], "published": "2023-08-12T03:15:09.330", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["flightbycanto"], "productName": ["Canto"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/leoanggal1/CVE-2023-3452-PoC", "https://github.com/leoanggal1/CVE-2023-3452-PoC"]}
