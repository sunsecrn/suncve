C-ares only uses this function internally for configuration purposes which would require an administrator to configure such an address via ares_set_sortlist(). However, users may externally use ares_inet_net_pton() for other purposes and thus be vulnerable to more severe issues. This issue has been fixed in 1.19.1.\n"], "published": "2023-05-25T22:15:09.760", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["c-ares"], "productName": ["c-ares"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/security/advisories/GHSA-x6mf-cxr9-8q6v"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["async", "c", "dns", "dns-queries", "library", "resolver"], "langs": {"C": 1443641, "M4": 132084, "CMake": 79870, "Makefile": 9553, "Shell": 5433, "Batchfile": 646}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16745161?v=4", "stargazers": 1936, "language": "C"}}, "pocList": []}
