This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access to change sitemap-related settings of the plugin. This vulnerability occurred as a result of the plugin relying on nonce checks as a means of access control, and that nonce being accessible to all authenticated users regardless of role."], "published": "2023-02-28T13:15:10.080", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["joomunited"], "productName": ["WP Meta SEO"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
