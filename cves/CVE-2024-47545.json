An integer underflow has been detected in qtdemux_parse_trak function within qtdemux.c. During the strf parsing case, the subtraction size -= 40 can lead to a negative integer overflow if it is less than 40. If this happens, the subsequent call to gst_buffer_fill will invoke memcpy with a large tocopy size, resulting in an OOB-read. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10."], "published": "2024-12-12T02:03:29.083", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gstreamer"], "productName": ["gstreamer"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
