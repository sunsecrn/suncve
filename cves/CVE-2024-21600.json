This will cause the FPC to hang and requires a manual restart to recover.\n\nPlease note that this issue specifically affects PTX1000, PTX3000, PTX5000 with FPC3, PTX10002-60C, and PTX10008/16 with LC110x. Other PTX Series devices and Line Cards (LC) are not affected.\n\nThe following log message can be seen when the issue occurs:\n\nCmerror Op Set: Host Loopback: HOST LOOPBACK WEDGE DETECTED IN PATH ID <id> (URI: /fpc/<fpc>/pfe/<pfe>/cm/<cm>/Host_Loopback/<cm>/HOST_LOOPBACK_MAKE_CMERROR_ID[<id>])\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS:\n\n\n\n  *  All versions earlier than 20.4R3-S8;\n  *  21.1 versions earlier than 21.1R3-S4;\n  *  21.2 versions earlier than 21.2R3-S6;\n  *  21.3 versions earlier than 21.3R3-S3;\n  *  21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S5;\n  *  22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R2-S2, 22.1R3;\n  *  22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R2-S1, 22.2R3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"], "published": "2024-01-12T01:15:47.857", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Juniper Networks"], "productName": ["Junos OS"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
