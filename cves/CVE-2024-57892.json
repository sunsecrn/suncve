Specifically, sb_dqinfo(sb, type)->dqi_priv is the\ndangling pointer.\n\nDuring the remounting process, the pointer dqi_priv is freed but is never\nset as null leaving it to be accessed.  Additionally, the read-only option\nfor remounting sets the DQUOT_SUSPENDED flag instead of setting the\nDQUOT_USAGE_ENABLED flags.  Moreover, later in the process of getting the\nnext quota, the function ocfs2_get_next_id is called and only checks the\nquota usage flags and not the quota suspended flags.\n\nTo fix this, I set dqi_priv to null when it is freed after remounting with\nread-only and put a check for DQUOT_SUSPENDED in ocfs2_get_next_id.\n\n[akpm@linux-foundation.org: coding-style cleanups]"], "published": "2025-01-15T13:15:13.710", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
