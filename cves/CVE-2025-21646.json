This\nalso allows us to be sure we can create the \"/afs/.<cell>/\" mountpoint too.\n\nFurther, split the YFS VL record cell name maximum to be the 256 allowed by\nthe protocol and ignore the record retrieved by YFSVL.GetCellName if it\nexceeds 253."], "published": "2025-01-19T11:15:10.197", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
