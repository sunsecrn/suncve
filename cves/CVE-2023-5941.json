Such overflows may lead to data corruption or the execution of arbitrary code at the privilege level of the calling program."], "published": "2023-11-08T09:15:07.847", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["FreeBSD"], "productName": ["FreeBSD"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
