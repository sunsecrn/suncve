This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to execute arbitrary shortcodes. This was partially fixed in version 1.4.8."], "published": "2024-12-06T10:15:05.107", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["kingyes"], "productName": ["Pojo Forms"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
