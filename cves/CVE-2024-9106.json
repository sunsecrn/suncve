This is due to insufficient verification on the user being supplied during the social login. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the user id. This is only exploitable if the app secret is not set, so it has a default empty value."], "published": "2024-10-01T08:15:05.267", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["xunhuweb"], "productName": ["Wechat Social login 微信QQ钉钉登录插件"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/RandomRobbieBF/CVE-2024-9106", "https://github.com/RandomRobbieBF/CVE-2024-9106"]}
