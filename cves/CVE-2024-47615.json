An OOB-Write has been detected in the function gst_parse_vorbis_setup_packet within vorbis_parse.c. The integer size is read from the input file without proper validation. As a result, size can exceed the fixed size of the pad->vorbis_mode_sizes array (which size is 256). When this happens, the for loop overwrites the entire pad structure with 0s and 1s, affecting adjacent memory as well. This OOB-write can overwrite up to 380 bytes of memory beyond the boundaries of the pad->vorbis_mode_sizes array. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10."], "published": "2024-12-12T02:03:32.940", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gstreamer"], "productName": ["gstreamer"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
