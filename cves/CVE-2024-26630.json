However, we\ndo not hold a reference to the folio before performing these actions,\nwhich means the folio can concurrently be released and reused as another\nfolio/page/slab.\n\nGet around this altogether by just using xarray's existing machinery for\nthe folio page offsets and dirty/writeback states.\n\nThis changes behavior for tmpfs files to now always report zeroes in their\ndirty and writeback counters.  This is okay as tmpfs doesn't follow\nconventional writeback cache behavior: its pages get \"cleaned\" during\nswapout, after which they're no longer resident etc."], "published": "2024-03-13T16:15:30.047", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
