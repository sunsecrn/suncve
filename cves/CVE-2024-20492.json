To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have Administrator-level credentials with read-write privileges on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a series of crafted CLI commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escape the restricted shell and gain root privileges on the underlying operating system of the affected device.\r\nNote: Cisco Expressway Series refers to Cisco Expressway Control (Expressway-C) devices and Cisco Expressway Edge (Expressway-E) devices."], "published": "2024-10-02T17:15:17.763", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) Expressway"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
