This information is gathered by looking up the value of `document.currentScript.src`. Prior to Pagefind version 1.1.1, it is possible to \"clobber\" this lookup with otherwise benign HTML on the page. This will cause `document.currentScript.src` to resolve as an external domain, which will then be used by Pagefind to load dependencies. This exploit would only work in the case that an attacker could inject HTML to a live, hosted, website. In these cases, this would act as a way to escalate the privilege available to an attacker. This assumes they have the ability to add some elements to the page (for example, `img` tags with a `name` attribute), but not others, as adding a `script` to the page would itself be the cross-site scripting vector. Pagefind has tightened this resolution in version 1.1.1 by ensuring the source is loaded from a valid script element. There are no reports of this being exploited in the wild via Pagefind."], "published": "2024-09-03T20:15:08.217", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["CloudCannon"], "productName": ["pagefind"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/CloudCannon/pagefind/security/advisories/GHSA-gprj-6m2f-j9hx", "https://github.com/webpack/webpack/security/advisories/GHSA-4vvj-4cpr-p986"], "commits": ["https://github.com/CloudCannon/pagefind/commit/14ec96864eabaf1d7d809d5da0186a8856261eeb"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/CloudCannon/pagefind/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Rust": 1180491, "JavaScript": 79822, "Svelte": 68060, "Python": 49182, "TypeScript": 45079, "CSS": 24490, "Shell": 9034, "HTML": 3082}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9701744?v=4", "stargazers": 4068, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
