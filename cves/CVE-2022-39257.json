Prior to version 0.23.19, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages appearing to have come from another person. Such messages will be marked with a grey shield on some platforms, but this may be missing in others. This attack is possible due to the matrix-ios-sdk implementing a too permissive key forwarding strategy. The default policy for accepting key forwards has been made more strict in the matrix-ios-sdk version 0.23.19. matrix-ios-sdk will now only accept forwarded keys in response to previously issued requests and only from own, verified devices. The SDK now sets a `trusted` flag on the decrypted message upon decryption, based on whether the key used to decrypt the message was received from a trusted source. Clients need to ensure that messages decrypted with a key with `trusted = false` are decorated appropriately (for example, by showing a warning for such messages). This attack requires coordination between a malicious home server and an attacker, so those who trust their home servers do not need a workaround."], "published": "2022-09-28T21:15:14.397", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["matrix-org"], "productName": ["matrix-ios-sdk"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-qxr3-5jmq-xcf4"], "commits": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk/commit/5ca86c328a5faaab429c240551cb9ca8f0f6262c"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Objective-C": 4660528, "Swift": 1648756, "C": 13782, "Ruby": 7523, "Python": 7499, "Shell": 3767, "Jinja": 2085}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8418310?v=4", "stargazers": 459, "language": "Objective-C"}}, "pocList": []}
