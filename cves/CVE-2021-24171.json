It was also possible to perform a double extension attack and upload files to a different location via path traversal using the \"wcuf_current_upload_session_id\" parameter."], "published": "2021-04-05T19:15:15.857", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Unknown"], "productName": ["WooCommerce Upload Files"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
