This is due to missing nonce validation in the 'admin_init_AAPL' function and missing file type validation in the 'AAPL_options_validate' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."], "published": "2024-07-09T08:15:11.733", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["deano1987"], "productName": ["Advanced AJAX Page Loader"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
