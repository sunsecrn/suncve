ORAS is both a CLI for initial testing and a Go Module. In ORAS from version 0.4.0 and before version 0.9.0, there is a \"zip-slip\" vulnerability. The directory support feature allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links. A well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. Users of the affected versions are impacted if they are `oras` CLI users who runs `oras pull`, or if they are Go programs, which invoke `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`. The problem has been fixed in version 0.9.0. For `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider. For `oras` package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`, and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider."], "published": "2021-01-25T19:15:12.847", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["deislabs"], "productName": ["oras"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/deislabs/oras/security/advisories/GHSA-g5v4-5x39-vwhx"], "commits": ["https://github.com/deislabs/oras/commit/96cd90423303f1bb42bd043cb4c36085e6e91e8e"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/deislabs/oras/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["docker", "oci", "registry", "storage"], "langs": {"Go": 912037, "Makefile": 6511, "Shell": 6358, "Dockerfile": 1038}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81890686?v=4", "stargazers": 1674, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
