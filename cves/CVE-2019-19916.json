This could result in script running where CSP should have blocked it, allowing for cross-site scripting (XSS) and other attacks when the product renders the content as HTML. Remediating this would also need to consider the polyglot case, e.g., a file that is a valid GIF image and also valid JavaScript."], "published": "2019-12-20T16:15:12.233", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
