A path traversal vulnerability exists in versions prior to 2.5.9. With a basic configuration, it is possible to access any file from a filesystem, using \"/../../\" in the URL. This occurs because Micronaut does not restrict file access to configured paths. The vulnerability is patched in version 2.5.9. As a workaround, do not use `**` in mapping, use only `*`, which exposes only flat structure of a directory not allowing traversal. If using Linux, another workaround is to run micronaut in chroot."], "published": "2021-07-16T19:15:07.893", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["micronaut-projects"], "productName": ["micronaut-core"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/security/advisories/GHSA-cjx7-399x-p2rj"], "commits": ["https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/commit/a0cfeb13bf1ef5d692d16d4a3b91b34b7456bb11"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cloudnative", "groovy", "java", "kotlin", "microservices", "serverless"], "langs": {"Java": 13355658, "Groovy": 7168368, "Kotlin": 1697768, "HTML": 143, "Shell": 14}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36880643?v=4", "stargazers": 6198, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
