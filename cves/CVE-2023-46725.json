Versions starting with 3.2.0 prior to 3.6.1 are vulnerable to server-side request forgery. In the Network module, a manufacturer account can use the `/api/updateProducts.json` endpoint to make the server send a request to an arbitrary host. This means that the server can be used as a proxy into the internal network where the server is. Furthermore, the checks on a valid image are not adequate, leading to a time of check time of use issue. For example, by using a custom server that returns 200 on HEAD requests, then return a valid image on first GET request and then a 302 redirect to final target on second GET request, the server will copy whatever file is at the redirect destination, making this a full SSRF. Version 3.6.1 fixes this vulnerability."], "published": "2023-11-02T15:15:08.847", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["foodcoopshop"], "productName": ["foodcoopshop"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/foodcoopshop/foodcoopshop/security/advisories/GHSA-jhww-fx2j-3rf7"], "commits": ["https://github.com/foodcoopshop/foodcoopshop/commit/0d5bec5c4c22e1affe7fd321a30e3f3a4d99e808"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/foodcoopshop/foodcoopshop/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["cakephp", "docker-dev", "food-coop", "foodcoop"], "langs": {"PHP": 3245776, "JavaScript": 434669, "CSS": 148201, "HTML": 88582, "Shell": 5589, "Batchfile": 834, "Dockerfile": 813}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21247591?v=4", "stargazers": 100, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
