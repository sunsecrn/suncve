Only the start position of\nNDP16 was checked, so it was possible for even the fixed-length part\nof NDP16 to extend past the end of URB, leading to an out-of-bounds\nread.\n\nOn iOS devices, the NDP16 header always directly follows NTH16. Rely on\nand check for this specific format.\n\nThis, along with NCM-specific minimal URB length check that already\nexists, will ensure that the fixed-length part of NDP16 plus a set\namount of DPEs fit within the URB.\n\nNote that this commit alone does not fully address the OoB read.\nThe limit on the amount of DPEs needs to be enforced separately."], "published": "2025-02-27T03:15:14.830", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
