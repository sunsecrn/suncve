In CarrierWave before versions 1.3.2 and 2.1.1, there is a code injection vulnerability. The \"#manipulate!\" method inappropriately evals the content of mutation option(:read/:write), allowing attackers to craft a string that can be executed as a Ruby code. If an application developer supplies untrusted inputs to the option, it will lead to remote code execution(RCE). This is fixed in versions 1.3.2 and 2.1.1."], "published": "2021-02-08T20:15:12.527", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["carrierwaveuploader"], "productName": ["carrierwave"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/security/advisories/GHSA-cf3w-g86h-35x4"], "commits": ["https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/commit/387116f5c72efa42bc3938d946b4c8d2f22181b7"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/security/advisories/GHSA-cf3w-g86h-35x4", "kw": ["proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Ruby": 601718, "Gherkin": 30231, "HTML": 1517}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3982589?v=4", "stargazers": 8783, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
