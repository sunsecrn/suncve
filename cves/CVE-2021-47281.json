It looks as if it's\nchecking the already existing timer instance at the beginning, but\nit's not right, because there is no protection, hence any later\nconcurrent call of snd_seq_timer_open() may override the timer\ninstance easily.  This may result in UAF, as the leftover timer\ninstance can keep running while the queue itself gets closed, as\nspotted by syzkaller recently.\n\nFor avoiding the race, add a proper check at the assignment of\ntmr->timeri again, and return -EBUSY if it's been already registered."], "published": "2024-05-21T15:15:16.353", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
