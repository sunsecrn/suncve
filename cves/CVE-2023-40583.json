In go-libp2p, by using signed peer records a malicious actor can store an arbitrary amount of data in a remote node’s memory. This memory does not get garbage collected and so the victim can run out of memory and crash. If users of go-libp2p in production are not monitoring memory consumption over time, it could be a silent attack i.e. the attacker could bring down nodes over a period of time (how long depends on the node resources i.e. a go-libp2p node on a virtual server with 4 gb of memory takes about 90 sec to bring down; on a larger server, it might take a bit longer.) This issue was patched in version 0.27.4."], "published": "2023-08-25T21:15:09.000", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["libp2p"], "productName": ["go-libp2p"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/security/advisories/GHSA-gcq9-qqwx-rgj3"], "commits": ["https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/commit/45d3c6fff662ddd6938982e7e9309ad5fa2ad8dd"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["libp2p", "networking-stack", "p2p"], "langs": {"Go": 2815244, "Shell": 13226, "Standard ML": 70}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14838238?v=4", "stargazers": 6316, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
