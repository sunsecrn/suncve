These keys are not uniquely generated per installation of the software. Combined with the encrypted password that can be obtained from \"WebAPI.cfg.xml\" in CVE-2024-39341, the decryption is trivial and can lead to privilege escalation on the Windows host."], "published": "2024-09-23T18:15:05.570", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
