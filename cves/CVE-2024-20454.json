An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overflow an internal buffer and execute arbitrary commands at the root privilege level."], "published": "2024-08-07T17:15:50.713", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Small Business IP Phones"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
