This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled."], "published": "2024-11-09T03:15:06.423", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["shtheme"], "productName": ["Anih - Creative Agency WordPress Theme"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
