This authentication is insufficient for channels created after the IPC process is started, leading to the authentication not being correctly applied to later channels. This could allow for a sandbox escape through IPC channels due to lack of message validation in the listener process. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 60.5, Firefox ESR < 60.5, and Firefox < 65."], "published": "2019-02-05T21:29:00.613", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Mozilla"], "productName": ["Thunderbird", "Firefox ESR", "Firefox"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
