In versions 3.06 and prior, the file `panorama.pm` is vulnerable to a Path Traversal vulnerability which allows an attacker to upload a file to any folder which has write permissions on the affected system. The parameter location is not filtered, validated or sanitized and it accepts any kind of characters. For a path traversal attack, the only characters required were the dot (`.`) and the slash (`/`). A fix is available in version 3.06.2."], "published": "2023-06-08T19:15:09.773", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["sni"], "productName": ["Thruk"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/sni/Thruk/security/advisories/GHSA-vhqc-649h-994h"], "commits": ["https://github.com/sni/Thruk/commit/26de047275c355c5ae2bbbc51b164f0f8bef5c5b", "https://github.com/sni/Thruk/commit/cf03f67621b7bb20e2c768bc62b30e976206aa17"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/sni/Thruk/security/advisories/GHSA-vhqc-649h-994h", "kw": ["poc", "proof of concept"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/sni/Thruk/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["icinga", "monitoring", "naemon", "nagios", "perl", "web"], "langs": {"Perl": 4643625, "JavaScript": 1450228, "CSS": 84965, "Shell": 48193, "Makefile": 26116, "Dockerfile": 12940, "Raku": 554, "HTML": 374}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/150844?v=4", "stargazers": 420, "language": "Perl"}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/galoget/Thruk-CVE-2023-34096", "https://github.com/galoget/Thruk-CVE-2023-34096"]}
