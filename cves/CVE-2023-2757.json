This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for subscriber-level attackers to access functions to save plugin data that can potentially lead to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."], "published": "2023-05-18T03:15:11.513", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["pluginbuilders"], "productName": ["Waiting: One-click countdowns"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
