Affected systems transmit client-side resources without proper cryptographic protection. This could allow an attacker to eavesdrop on and modify resources in transit. A successful exploit requires an attacker to be in the network path between the RTLS Locating Manager server and a client (MitM)."], "published": "2024-05-14T16:16:49.580", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Siemens"], "productName": ["SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
