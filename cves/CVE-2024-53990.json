When making any HTTP request, the automatically enabled and self-managed CookieStore (aka cookie jar) will silently replace explicitly defined Cookies with any that have the same name from the cookie jar. For services that operate with multiple users, this can result in one user's Cookie being used for another user's requests."], "published": "2024-12-02T18:15:11.753", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["AsyncHttpClient"], "productName": ["async-http-client"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/security/advisories/GHSA-mfj5-cf8g-g2fv"], "commits": ["https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/commit/d5a83362f7aed81b93ebca559746ac9be0f95425"], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/security/advisories/GHSA-mfj5-cf8g-g2fv", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["ahc", "async", "asynchttpclient", "http-client", "java", "netty"], "langs": {"Java": 1834964}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/381412?v=4", "stargazers": 6333, "language": "Java"}}, "pocList": []}
