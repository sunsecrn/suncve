Furthermore, the attacker will need an account to restore the settings backup, or convince a user with such access to upload a modified backup file.\n\nImpact: Critical – The attacker has full control over the charging station as the root user, and can arbitrarily add, modify and deletefiles and services.\n\nCVSS clarification: Any network interface serving the web ui is vulnerable (AV:N) and there are not additional security measures to circumvent (AC:L), nor does the attack require and existing preconditions (AT:N). The attack is authenticated, but the level of authentication does not matter (PR:L), nor is any user interaction required (UI:N). The attack leads to a full compromised (VC:H/VI:H/VA:H), and compromised devices can be used to pivot into networks that should potentially not be accessible (SC:L/SI:L/SA:H). Becuase this is an EV charger handing significant power, there is a potential safety impact (S:P). This attack can be automated (AU:Y)."], "published": "2025-01-09T08:15:28.487", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Iocharger"], "productName": ["Iocharger firmware for AC models"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
