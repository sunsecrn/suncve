An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted file containing OLE2 content to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to terminate, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected software and consuming available system resources.\r\n\r For a description of this vulnerability, see the ClamAV blog ."], "published": "2024-02-07T17:15:10.517", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Secure Endpoint", "Cisco Secure Endpoint Private Cloud Administration Portal", "Cisco Secure Endpoint Private Cloud Console"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
