As the result of this design, any authenticated user may create his own dmr_content object, pointing to already existing content in the Content Server filesystem."], "published": "2017-10-13T16:29:00.297", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
