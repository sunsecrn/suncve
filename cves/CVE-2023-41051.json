The vm-memory rust crate provides a set of traits to decouple VM memory consumers from VM memory providers. An issue was discovered in the default implementations of the `VolatileMemory::{get_atomic_ref, aligned_as_ref, aligned_as_mut, get_ref, get_array_ref}` trait functions, which allows out-of-bounds memory access if the `VolatileMemory::get_slice` function returns a `VolatileSlice` whose length is less than the function’s `count` argument. No implementations of `get_slice` provided in `vm_memory` are affected. Users of custom `VolatileMemory` implementations may be impacted if the custom implementation does not adhere to `get_slice`'s documentation. The issue started in version 0.1.0 but was fixed in version 0.12.2 by inserting a check that verifies that the `VolatileSlice` returned by `get_slice` is of the correct length. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n"], "published": "2023-09-01T19:15:42.883", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["rust-vmm"], "productName": ["vm-memory"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/security/advisories/GHSA-49hh-fprx-m68g"], "commits": ["https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/commit/aff1dd4a5259f7deba56692840f7a2d9ca34c9c8"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Rust": 357512}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46028664?v=4", "stargazers": 320, "language": "Rust"}}, "pocList": []}
