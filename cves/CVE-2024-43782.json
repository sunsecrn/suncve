Before moving to pulling translations from the openedx-translations repository via openedx-atlas, translations in the edx-platform repository were validated using edx-i18n-tools. This validation included protection against malformed translations and translations-based script injections. Prior to this patch, the validation implemented in the openedx-translations repository did not include the same protections. The maintainer inspected the translations in the edx-platform directory of both the main and open-release/redwood.master branches of the openedx-translations repository and found no evidence of exploited translation strings."], "published": "2024-08-23T15:15:16.600", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["openedx"], "productName": ["openedx-translations"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations/security/advisories/GHSA-fg8c-2pvj-wx3j"], "commits": ["https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations/commit/3c4093705dec99590577c4d8270ce263f7fffc5a", "https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations/commit/b2444340e8702c7955310331c1db5fd85b25b92b"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Python": 37942, "Makefile": 2019, "Shell": 1375}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40179672?v=4", "stargazers": 4, "language": "Python"}}, "pocList": []}
