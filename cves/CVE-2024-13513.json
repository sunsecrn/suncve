This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data including the plugin's clientToken, which in turn can be used to change user account information including emails and account type. This allows attackers to then change account passwords resulting in a complete site takeover. Version 2.4.2.3 disabled logging but left sites with existing log files vulnerable."], "published": "2025-02-15T08:15:07.790", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["oliverpos"], "productName": ["Oliver POS – A WooCommerce Point of Sale (POS)"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
