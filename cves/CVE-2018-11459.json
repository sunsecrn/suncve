A local attacker could modify a user-writeable configuration file so that after reboot or manual initiation the system reloads the modified configuration file and attacker-controlled code is executed with elevated privileges. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with local access to the affected system. Successful exploitation requires user privileges but no user interaction. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to compromise confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system.
