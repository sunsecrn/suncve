Continued receipt and processing of these BGP updates will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\nThis issue is hit when the router has Non-Stop Routing (NSR) enabled, has a non-4-byte-AS capable BGP neighbor, receives a BGP update message with a prefix that includes a long AS PATH containing large number of 4-byte ASes, and has to advertise the prefix towards the non-4-byte-AS capable BGP neighbor.\n\nNote: NSR is not supported on the SRX Series and is therefore not affected by this vulnerability.\nThis issue affects:\n\nJuniper Networks Junos OS:\n\n\n\n  *  All versions prior to 20.4R3-S8;\n  *  21.1 versions 21.1R1 and later;\n  *  21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S6;\n  *  21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S5;\n  *  21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S5;\n  *  22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S4;\n  *  22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3-S2;\n  *  22.3 versions prior to 22.3R2-S2, 22.3R3-S1;\n  *  22.4 versions prior to 22.4R2-S1, 22.4R3.\n\n\n\n\nJuniper Networks Junos OS Evolved\n\n\n\n  *  All versions prior to 20.4R3-S8-EVO;\n  *  21.1 versions 21.1R1-EVO and later;\n  *  21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S6-EVO;\n  *  21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S5-EVO;\n  *  21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S5-EVO;\n  *  22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S4-EVO;\n  *  22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3-S2-EVO;\n  *  22.3 versions prior to 22.3R2-S2-EVO, 22.3R3-S1-EVO;\n  *  22.4 versions prior to 22.4R2-S1-EVO, 22.4R3-EVO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"], "published": "2023-10-11T21:15:09.890", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Juniper Networks"], "productName": ["Junos OS", "Junos OS Evolved"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
