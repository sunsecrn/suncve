For example, if rsh is a link to ssh (as seen on Debian and Ubuntu systems), then the attack can use an IMAP server name containing a \"-oProxyCommand\" argument."], "published": "2018-11-25T10:29:00.250", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/ensimag-security/CVE-2018-19518", "https://github.com/houqe/EXP_CVE-2018-19518", "https://github.com/ensimag-security/CVE-2018-19518", "https://github.com/houqe/EXP_CVE-2018-19518"]}
