An OOB-read has been discovered in gst_wavparse_cue_chunk within gstwavparse.c. The vulnerability happens due to a discrepancy between the size of the data buffer and the size value provided to the function. This mismatch causes the comparison  if (size < 4 + ncues * 24) to fail in some cases, allowing the subsequent loop to access beyond the bounds of the data buffer. The root cause of this discrepancy stems from a miscalculation when clipping the chunk size based on upstream data size. This vulnerability allows reading beyond the bounds of the data buffer, potentially leading to a crash (denial of service) or the leak of sensitive data. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10."], "published": "2024-12-12T02:03:40.557", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["gstreamer"], "productName": ["gstreamer"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
