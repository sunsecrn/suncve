Log an error and discard the notification\ninstead of reading lengths from memory outside the received data, which can\nlead to memory corruption when the expected_size decreases between\nfragments, causing `expected_size - acm->nb_index` to wrap.\n\nThis issue has been present since the beginning of git history; however,\nit only leads to memory corruption since commit ea2583529cd1\n(\"cdc-acm: reassemble fragmented notifications\").\n\nA mitigating factor is that acm_ctrl_irq() can only execute after userspace\nhas opened /dev/ttyACM*; but if ModemManager is running, ModemManager will\ndo that automatically depending on the USB device's vendor/product IDs and\nits other interfaces."], "published": "2025-02-22T10:15:11.263", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
