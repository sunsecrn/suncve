Prior to version 19.7.0, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages appearing to have come from another person. Such messages will be marked with a grey shield on some platforms, but this may be missing in others. This attack is possible due to the matrix-js-sdk implementing a too permissive key forwarding strategy on the receiving end. Starting with version 19.7.0, the default policy for accepting key forwards has been made more strict in the matrix-js-sdk. matrix-js-sdk will now only accept forwarded keys in response to previously issued requests and only from own, verified devices. The SDK now sets a `trusted` flag on the decrypted message upon decryption, based on whether the key used to decrypt the message was received from a trusted source. Clients need to ensure that messages decrypted with a key with `trusted = false` are decorated appropriately, for example, by showing a warning for such messages. This attack requires coordination between a malicious homeserver and an attacker, and those who trust your homeservers do not need a workaround."], "published": "2022-09-28T20:15:16.127", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["matrix-org"], "productName": ["matrix-js-sdk"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-6263-x97c-c4gg"], "commits": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/commit/a587d7c36026fe1fcf93dfff63588abee359be76"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["hacktoberfest", "matrix", "matrix-chat", "matrix-sdk"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 5464276, "Python": 25161, "JavaScript": 17587, "Shell": 521}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8418310?v=4", "stargazers": 1750, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
