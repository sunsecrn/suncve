An attacker can use two HTTP requests to upload a malformed GGUF file containing just 4 bytes starting with the GGUF custom magic header. By leveraging a custom Modelfile that includes a FROM statement pointing to the attacker-controlled blob file, the attacker can crash the application through the CreateModel route, leading to a segmentation fault (signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation)."], "published": "2024-10-31T20:15:04.877", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
