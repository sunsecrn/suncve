This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain allows attackers to delete arbitrary files and achieve remote code execution. This is essentially the same vulnerability as CVE-2024-5932, however, it was discovered the the presence of stripslashes_deep on user_info allows the is_serialized check to be bypassed. This issue was mostly patched in 3.16.1, but further hardening was added in 3.16.2."], "published": "2024-09-28T02:15:09.880", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["webdevmattcrom"], "productName": ["GiveWP – Donation Plugin and Fundraising Platform"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/EQSTLab/CVE-2024-8353", "https://github.com/EQSTLab/CVE-2024-8353"]}
