This could allow a local attacker to gain root privileges by bind-mounting their own contents inside the snap's private mount namespace and causing snap-confine to execute arbitrary code and hence gain privilege escalation. Fixed in snapd versions 2.54.3+18.04, 2.54.3+20.04 and 2.54.3+21.10.1"], "published": "2022-02-17T23:15:07.473", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Canonical Ltd."], "productName": ["snapd"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/deeexcee-io/CVE-2021-44731-snap-confine-SUID", "https://github.com/deeexcee-io/CVE-2021-44731-snap-confine-SUID"]}
