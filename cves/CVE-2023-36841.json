This results in consuming all resources and a manual restart is needed to recover.\n\nThis issue affects interfaces with PPPoE configured and tcp-mss enabled.\n\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS\n\n\n\n  *  All versions prior to 20.4R3-S7;\n  *  21.1 version 21.1R1 and later versions;\n  *  21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S6;\n  *  21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S5;\n  *  21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S3;\n  *  22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S4;\n  *  22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3;\n  *  22.3 versions prior to 22.3R2-S2;\n  *  22.4 versions prior to 22.4R2;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"], "published": "2023-10-12T23:15:10.967", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Juniper Networks"], "productName": ["Junos OS"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
