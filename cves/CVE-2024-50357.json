But, REST-APIs are unexpectedly enabled when the affected product is powered up, provided either http-server (GUI) or Web authentication is enabled. The factory default configuration makes http-server (GUI) enabled, which means REST-APIs are also enabled. The username and the password for REST-APIs are configured in the factory default configuration. As a result, an attacker may obtain and/or alter the affected product's settings via REST-APIs."], "published": "2024-11-29T10:15:10.833", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Century Systems Co., Ltd."], "productName": ["FutureNet NXR-G110 series", "FutureNet NXR-G060 series", "FutureNet NXR-G050 series"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
