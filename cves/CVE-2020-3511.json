The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation when the ISDN Q.931 messages are processed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious ISDN Q.931 message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the process to crash, resulting in a reload of the affected device."], "published": "2020-09-24T18:15:21.230", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco IOS "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
