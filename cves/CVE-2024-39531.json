If, for example, OSPF was configured with a certain bandwidth value, ISIS would also be limited to this value. So inadvertently either the control plane is open for a high level of specific traffic which was supposed to be limited to a lower value, or the limit for a certain protocol is so low that chances to succeed with a volumetric DoS attack are significantly increased. \n\n\n\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS Evolved on ACX 7000 Series:\n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S7-EVO,\n  *  22.1 versions before 22.1R3-S6-EVO, \n  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S3-EVO,\n  *  22.3 versions before 22.3R3-S3-EVO, \n  *  22.4 versions before 22.4R3-S2-EVO,\n  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2-EVO,\n  *  23.4 \n\nversions \n\nbefore 23.4R1-S1-EVO, 23.4R2-EVO."], "published": "2024-07-11T17:15:10.150", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Juniper Networks"], "productName": ["Junos OS Evolved"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
