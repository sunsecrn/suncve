This is due to a lack of sanitization on user-supplied values, which replace values in the style.php file, along with missing capability checks. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute code on the server. This issue was partially patched in 2.8.6 when the code injection issue was resolved, and fully patched in 2.8.7 when the missing authorization and cross-site request forgery protection was added."], "published": "2024-08-13T03:15:04.400", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["rabilal"], "productName": ["JS Help Desk – The Ultimate Help Desk & Support Plugin"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/nastar-id/CVE-2024-7094", "https://github.com/nastar-id/CVE-2024-7094"]}
