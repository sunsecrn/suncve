As part of the\nremoval procedure, device_del() waits for all ongoing sysfs attribute\ncallbacks to complete.  But usb_deauthorize_interface() can't complete\nuntil the device lock has been released, and the lock won't be\nreleased until the removal has finished.\n\nThe mechanism provided by sysfs to prevent this kind of deadlock is\nto use the sysfs_break_active_protection() function, which tells sysfs\nnot to wait for the attribute callback.\n\nReported-and-tested by: Yue Sun <samsun1006219@gmail.com>\nReported by: xingwei lee <xrivendell7@gmail.com>"], "published": "2024-05-01T06:15:08.090", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
