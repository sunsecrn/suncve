When group SAML SSO is configured, the SCIM feature (available only on Premium+ subscriptions) may allow any owner of a Premium group to invite arbitrary users through their username and email, then change those users' email addresses via SCIM to an attacker controlled email address and thus - in the absence of 2FA - take over those accounts. It is also possible for the attacker to change the display name and username of the targeted account."], "published": "2022-06-06T18:15:08.417", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["GitLab"], "productName": ["GitLab"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
