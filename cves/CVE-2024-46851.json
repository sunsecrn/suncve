The pipe\ncontext passed to dcn10_set_drr() is a member of this resource context.\n\nIf dc_state_destruct() is called parallel to the IRQ processing (which\ncalls dcn10_set_drr() at some point), we can end up using already nulled\nfunction callback fields of struct stream_resource.\n\nThe logic in dcn10_set_drr() already tries to avoid this, by checking tg\nagainst NULL. But if the nulling happens exactly after the NULL check and\nbefore the next access, then we get a race.\n\nAvoid this by copying tg first to a local variable, and then use this\nvariable for all the operations. This should work, as long as nobody\nfrees the resource pool where the timing generators live.\n\n(cherry picked from commit a3cc326a43bdc48fbdf53443e1027a03e309b643)"], "published": "2024-09-27T13:15:16.850", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
