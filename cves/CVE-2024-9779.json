The cluster-manager deployment uses a service account with the same name \"cluster-manager\" which is bound to a ClusterRole also named \"cluster-manager\", which includes the permission to create Pod resources. If this deployment runs a pod on an attacker-controlled node, the attacker can obtain the cluster-manager's token and steal any service account token by creating and mounting the target service account to control the whole cluster."], "published": "2024-12-17T23:15:05.603", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Red Hat"], "productName": ["Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes 2"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
