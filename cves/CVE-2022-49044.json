In this\nsituation, a part of the digest beyond tag_size is ignored.\n\nIn this case, dm-integrity would write beyond the end of the\nic->recalc_tags array and corrupt memory. The corruption happened in\nintegrity_recalc->integrity_sector_checksum->crypto_shash_final.\n\nFix this corruption by increasing the tags array so that it has enough\npadding at the end to accomodate the loop in integrity_recalc() being\nable to write a full digest size for the last member of the tags\narray."], "published": "2025-02-26T07:00:41.680", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
