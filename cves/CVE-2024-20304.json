An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust the incoming UDP packet memory. The affected device would not be able to process higher-level UDP-based protocols packets, possibly causing a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\nNote: This vulnerability can be exploited using IPv4 or IPv6."], "published": "2024-09-11T17:15:11.853", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco IOS XR Software"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
