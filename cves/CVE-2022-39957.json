A client can issue an HTTP Accept header field containing an optional \"charset\" parameter in order to receive the response in an encoded form. Depending on the \"charset\", this response can not be decoded by the web application firewall. A restricted resource, access to which would ordinarily be detected, may therefore bypass detection. The legacy CRS versions 3.0.x and 3.1.x are affected, as well as the currently supported versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators and users are advised to upgrade to 3.2.2 and 3.3.3 respectively."], "published": "2022-09-20T07:15:12.353", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["OWASP"], "productName": ["ModSecurity Core Rule Set"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
