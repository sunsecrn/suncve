This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. By default, this can only be exploited by administrators, but the ability to use and configure Photo Gallery can be extended to contributors on pro versions of the plugin."], "published": "2024-06-07T10:15:11.627", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["10web"], "productName": ["Photo Gallery by 10Web – Mobile-Friendly Image Gallery"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
