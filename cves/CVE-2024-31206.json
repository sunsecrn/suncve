In `dectalk-tts@1.0.0`, network requests to the third-party API are sent over HTTP, which is unencrypted. Unencrypted traffic can be easily intercepted and modified by attackers. Anyone who uses the package could be the victim of a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The network request was upgraded to HTTPS in version `1.0.1`. There are no workarounds, but some precautions include not sending any sensitive information and carefully verifying the API response before saving it."], "published": "2024-04-04T23:15:15.897", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["JstnMcBrd"], "productName": ["dectalk-tts"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts/security/advisories/GHSA-6cf6-8hvr-r68w"], "commits": ["https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts/commit/3600d8ac156f27da553ac4ead46d16989a350105"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["api", "dectalk", "text-to-speech", "tts", "wav"], "langs": {"TypeScript": 3038, "JavaScript": 105}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28303477?v=4", "stargazers": 1, "language": "TypeScript"}}, "pocList": []}
