It utilizes web sockets for instant interactions and real-time notifications. `utils.generateUUID`, a helper function available in essentially all versions of NodeBB (as far back as v1.0.1 and potentially earlier) used a cryptographically insecure Pseudo-random number generator (`Math.random()`), which meant that a specially crafted script combined with multiple invocations of the password reset functionality could enable an attacker to correctly calculate the reset code for an account they do not have access to. This vulnerability impacts all installations of NodeBB. The vulnerability allows for an attacker to take over any account without the involvement of the victim, and as such, the remediation should be applied immediately (either via NodeBB upgrade or cherry-pick of the specific changeset. The vulnerability has been patched in version 2.x and 1.19.x. There is no known workaround, but the patch sets listed above will fully patch the vulnerability."], "published": "2022-08-31T15:15:08.857", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["NodeBB"], "productName": ["NodeBB"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/security/advisories/GHSA-p4cc-w597-6cpm"], "commits": ["https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/commit/81e3c1ba488d03371a5ce8d0ebb5c5803026e0f9", "https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/commit/e802fab87f94a13f397f04cfe6068f2f7ddf7888"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["community", "forum", "javascript", "mongodb", "node", "nodebb", "nodejs", "postgresql", "redis", "socket-io", "websockets"], "langs": {"JavaScript": 3908503, "Smarty": 503502, "SCSS": 35001, "HTML": 6457, "Shell": 5633, "Dockerfile": 4900, "CSS": 3261, "Batchfile": 42}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4449608?v=4", "stargazers": 14511, "language": "JavaScript"}}, "pocList": []}
