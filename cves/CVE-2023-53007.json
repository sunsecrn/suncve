But if a crash happens, and\n\"ftrace_dump_on_oops\" is set on the kernel command line, all you get will\nbe:\n\n  [    0.456075]   <idle>-0         0dN.2. 347519us : Unknown type 6\n  [    0.456075]   <idle>-0         0dN.2. 353141us : Unknown type 6\n  [    0.456075]   <idle>-0         0dN.2. 358684us : Unknown type 6\n\nThis is because the trace_printk() event (type 6) hasn't been registered\nyet. That gets done via an early_initcall(), which may be early, but not\nearly enough.\n\nInstead of registering the trace_printk() event (and other ftrace events,\nwhich are not trace events) via an early_initcall(), have them registered at\nthe same time that trace_printk() can be used. This way, if there is a\ncrash before early_initcall(), then the trace_printk()s will actually be\nuseful."], "published": "2025-03-27T17:15:49.670", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
