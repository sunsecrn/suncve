So a check was missing in zlog_rule_new() while copying the record_name from file_path + 1 which caused the buffer overflow. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to overwrite the zlog_record_fn record_func function pointer to get arbitrary code execution or potentially cause remote code execution (RCE)."], "published": "2024-03-07T01:15:52.640", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
