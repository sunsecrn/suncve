Vectors don't require queues to be\npresent, so this is safe. Additionally, this change allows to remove\nthat useless queue->q_vector pointer cleanup, as vectors are still\nvalid when freeing the queues (+ both are freed within one function,\nso it's not clear why nullify the pointers at all)."], "published": "2024-08-26T11:15:05.500", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
