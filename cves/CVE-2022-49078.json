As reported by KASAN [1], LZ4_decompress_safe_partial\nmay lead to read out of bound problem during decoding.  lz4 upstream has\nfixed it [2] and this issue has been disscussed here [3] before.\n\ncurrent decompression routine was ported from lz4 v1.8.3, bumping\nlib/lz4 to v1.9.+ is certainly a huge work to be done later, so, we'd\nbetter fix it first.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/all/000000000000830d1205cf7f0477@google.com/\n[2] https://github.com/lz4/lz4/commit/c5d6f8a8be3927c0bec91bcc58667a6cfad244ad#\n[3] https://lore.kernel.org/all/CC666AE8-4CA4-4951-B6FB-A2EFDE3AC03B@fb.com/"], "published": "2025-02-26T07:00:45.153", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
