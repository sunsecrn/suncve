This is due to insufficient validation and capability check on the 'rover_idx_refresh_social_callback' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to log in to administrator. The vulnerability is partially patched in version 3.0.0.2905 and fully patched in version 3.0.0.2906."], "published": "2024-10-22T05:15:03.513", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["stevemullen"], "productName": ["Rover IDX"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
