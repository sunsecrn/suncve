The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information."], "published": "2019-01-24T16:29:00.363", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco WebEx Meetings Server "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
