This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add arbitrary file paths (such as ../../../../wp-config.php) to uploaded files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when an Administrator deletes the message. Exploiting this vulnerability requires the Flamingo plugin to be installed and activated."], "published": "2025-03-28T07:15:39.243", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["glenwpcoder"], "productName": ["Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for Contact Form 7"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
