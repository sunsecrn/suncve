For consistency, this\nfix just changes the assignments to both fields to use the OPTS_SET()\nmacro."], "published": "2024-05-01T13:15:50.070", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
