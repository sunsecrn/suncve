The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the parameters of an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting a user's HTTP request and modifying it into a request that causes the web interface to redirect the user to a specific malicious URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to redirect a user to a malicious web page. This type of vulnerability is known as an open redirect attack and is used in phishing attacks that get users to unknowingly visit malicious sites."], "published": "2020-09-23T01:15:13.253", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco Managed Services Accelerator "], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
