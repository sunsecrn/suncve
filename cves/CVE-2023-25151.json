The v0.38.0 release of `go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp` uses the `httpconv.ServerRequest` function to annotate metric measurements for the `http.server.request_content_length`, `http.server.response_content_length`, and `http.server.duration` instruments. The `ServerRequest` function sets the `http.target` attribute value to be the whole request URI (including the query string)[^1]. The metric instruments do not \"forget\" previous measurement attributes when `cumulative` temporality is used, this means the cardinality of the measurements allocated is directly correlated with the unique URIs handled. If the query string is constantly random, this will result in a constant increase in memory allocation that can be used in a denial-of-service attack. This issue has been addressed in version 0.39.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."], "published": "2023-02-08T20:15:24.620", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["open-telemetry"], "productName": ["opentelemetry-go-contrib"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/security/advisories/GHSA-5r5m-65gx-7vrh"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Go": 2363578, "Shell": 17687, "Makefile": 12038, "Dockerfile": 2655, "HTML": 2546, "sed": 183}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49998002?v=4", "stargazers": 1367, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
