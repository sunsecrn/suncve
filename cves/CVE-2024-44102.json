The affected system allows remote users to send maliciously crafted objects. Due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied content by the affected software, an unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a maliciously crafted serialized object. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device with SYSTEM privileges."], "published": "2024-11-12T13:15:08.203", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Siemens"], "productName": ["PP TeleControl Server Basic 1000 to 5000 V3.1", "PP TeleControl Server Basic 256 to 1000 V3.1", "PP TeleControl Server Basic 32 to 64 V3.1", "PP TeleControl Server Basic 64 to 256 V3.1", "PP TeleControl Server Basic 8 to 32 V3.1", "TeleControl Server Basic 1000 V3.1", "TeleControl Server Basic 256 V3.1", "TeleControl Server Basic 32 V3.1", "TeleControl Server Basic 5000 V3.1", "TeleControl Server Basic 64 V3.1", "TeleControl Server Basic 8 V3.1", "TeleControl Server Basic Serv Upgr", "TeleControl Server Basic Upgr V3.1"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
