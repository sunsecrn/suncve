According\nto RCU usage rules, this is illegal and can lead to unpredictable\nbehavior, such as accessing memory that has been updated or causing\nuse-after-free issues.\n\nThis possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developed\nby myself, specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues.\n\nTo address this, the `scan_req->type` value is now stored in a local\nvariable `scan_req_type` while still within the RCU read-side critical\nsection. The `scan_req_type` is then used after the RCU lock is released,\nensuring that the type value is safely accessed without violating RCU\nrules."], "published": "2024-10-21T19:15:04.143", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
