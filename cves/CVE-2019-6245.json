In the function agg::cell_aa::not_equal, dx is assigned to (x2 - x1). If dx >= dx_limit, which is (16384 << poly_subpixel_shift), this function will call itself recursively. There can be a situation where (x2 - x1) is always bigger than dx_limit during the recursion, leading to continual stack consumption."], "published": "2019-01-13T00:29:00.477", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
