This flaw exists due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in LTI provider library. The library does not utilise Moodle's inbuilt cURL helper, which resulted in a blind SSRF risk. An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request and trick the application to initiate requests to arbitrary systems. This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to perform SSRF attacks."], "published": "2022-11-25T19:15:12.107", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["Moodle"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
