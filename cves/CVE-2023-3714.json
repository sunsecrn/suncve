This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with group ownership, to update group options, including the 'associate_role' parameter, which defines the member's role. This issue was partially patched in version 5.5.2 preventing privilege escalation, however, it was fully patched in 5.5.3."], "published": "2023-07-18T03:15:56.207", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["metagauss"], "productName": ["ProfileGrid – User Profiles, Memberships, Groups and Communities"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
