While this allocation failure is\nhandled properly and request is rejected, it results in syzkaller\nreports. Additionally, such request may put undue burden on the\nsystem which will try to free a lot of memory for a bogus request.\n\nFix it by limiting allowed number of slots to 100. This can easily\nbe extended if we see devices that can track more than 100 contacts."], "published": "2024-09-18T08:15:03.667", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
