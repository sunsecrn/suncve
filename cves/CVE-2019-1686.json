The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of the ACL applied to an interface of an affected device when Cisco Express Forwarding load balancing using the 3-tuple hash algorithm is enabled. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic through an affected device that should otherwise be denied by the configured ACL. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass protection offered by a configured ACL on the affected device. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability. Affected Cisco IOS XR versions are: Cisco IOS XR Software Release 5.1.1 and later till first fixed.
