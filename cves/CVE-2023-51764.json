Remote attackers can use a published exploitation technique to inject e-mail messages with a spoofed MAIL FROM address, allowing bypass of an SPF protection mechanism. This occurs because Postfix supports <LF>.<CR><LF> but some other popular e-mail servers do not. To prevent attack variants (by always disallowing <LF> without <CR>), a different solution is required, such as the smtpd_forbid_bare_newline=yes option with a Postfix minimum version of 3.5.23, 3.6.13, 3.7.9, 3.8.4, or 3.9."], "published": "2023-12-24T05:15:08.273", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/duy-31/CVE-2023-51764", "https://github.com/eeenvik1/CVE-2023-51764", "https://github.com/d4op/CVE-2023-51764-POC", "https://github.com/Double-q1015/CVE-2023-51764", "https://github.com/duy-31/CVE-2023-51764", "https://github.com/eeenvik1/CVE-2023-51764", "https://github.com/d4op/CVE-2023-51764-POC", "https://github.com/Double-q1015/CVE-2023-51764"]}
