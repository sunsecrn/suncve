The problem has been patched as of commit `5defd92`, and users are advised to upgrade. Attackers do need posting privilege in order to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability is present within the 0.1.0 release, and users are advised to upgrade to 0.1.1. Users unable to upgrade may be able to work around the attack by either; Removing the ability to create posts, removing the `|safe` tag from the Jinja2 template titled \"post.html\" in templates or by adding manual validation of links in the post creation section."], "published": "2023-06-19T18:15:09.763", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["benjjvi"], "productName": ["PyBB"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/benjjvi/PyBB/security/advisories/GHSA-mv96-w49p-438p"], "commits": ["https://github.com/benjjvi/PyBB/commit/5defd922ab05a193a783392d447c6538628cf854"], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": "https://github.com/benjjvi/PyBB/", "info": {"exist": false, "topics": null, "langs": {}, "avatar": null, "stargazers": 0, "language": null}}, "pocList": []}
