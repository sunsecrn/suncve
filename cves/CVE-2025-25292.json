An authentication bypass vulnerability was found in ruby-saml prior to versions 1.12.4 and 1.18.0 due to a parser differential. ReXML and Nokogiri parse XML differently, the parsers can generate entirely different document structures from the same XML input. That allows an attacker to be able to execute a Signature Wrapping attack. This issue may lead to authentication bypass. Versions 1.12.4 and 1.18.0 contain a patch for the issue."], "published": "2025-03-12T21:15:42.177", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["SAML-Toolkits"], "productName": ["ruby-saml"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/SAML-Toolkits/ruby-saml/security/advisories/GHSA-754f-8gm6-c4r2", "https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth-saml/security/advisories/GHSA-hw46-3hmr-x9xv"], "commits": ["https://github.com/SAML-Toolkits/ruby-saml/commit/e76c5b36bac40aedbf1ba7ffaaf495be63328cd9", "https://github.com/SAML-Toolkits/ruby-saml/commit/e9c1cdbd0f9afa467b585de279db0cbd0fb8ae97"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/SAML-Toolkits/ruby-saml/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": [], "langs": {"Ruby": 558976}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116213842?v=4", "stargazers": 944, "language": "Ruby"}}, "pocList": []}
