The attacker can provide TopicBindingName and TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName configurations causing JMSAppender to perform JNDI requests that result in remote code execution in a similar fashion to CVE-2021-44228. Note this issue only affects Log4j 1.2 when specifically configured to use JMSAppender, which is not the default. Apache Log4j 1.2 reached end of life in August 2015. Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it addresses numerous other issues from the previous versions."], "published": "2021-12-14T12:15:12.200", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Apache Software Foundation"], "productName": ["Apache Log4j 1.x"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": ["https://github.com/cckuailong/log4shell_1.x", "https://github.com/cckuailong/log4shell_1.x"]}
