A successful attack requires a SAML identity provider to be configured. In order to exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must know the unique SAML callback ID of the configured identity source. A remote attacker can send a request crafted with an XXE payload to invoke a malicious DTD hosted on a system that they control. This results in reading local files that the application has access to."], "published": "2022-05-24T15:15:08.480", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["n/a"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
