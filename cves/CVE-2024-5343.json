This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'rbs_ajax_create_article' and 'rbs_ajax_reset_views' functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create new posts and reset gallery view counts via a forged request granted they can trick a Contributor+ level user into performing an action such as clicking on a link."], "published": "2024-06-19T06:15:11.723", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["robosoft"], "productName": ["Photo Gallery, Images, Slider in Rbs Image Gallery"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
