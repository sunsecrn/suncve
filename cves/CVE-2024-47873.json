The XmlScanner class has a scan method which should prevent XXE attacks. However, prior to versions 1.9.4, 2.1.3, 2.3.2, and 3.4.0, the regexes used in the `scan` method and the findCharSet method can be bypassed by using UCS-4 and encoding guessing. An attacker can bypass the sanitizer and achieve an XML external entity attack. Versions 1.9.4, 2.1.3, 2.3.2, and 3.4.0 fix the issue."], "published": "2024-11-18T17:15:11.973", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["PHPOffice"], "productName": ["PhpSpreadsheet"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/security/advisories/GHSA-jw4x-v69f-hh5w"], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": {"url": "https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/security/advisories/GHSA-jw4x-v69f-hh5w", "kw": ["poc"]}, "repo": "https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["excel", "gnumeric", "hacktoberfest", "libreoffice", "msexcel", "ods", "office", "php", "phpexcel", "spreadsheet", "sylk", "xls", "xlsx"], "langs": {"PHP": 8449662, "HTML": 7409, "Shell": 885}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1836015?v=4", "stargazers": 13579, "language": "PHP"}}, "pocList": []}
