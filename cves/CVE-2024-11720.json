This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This is only exploitable when lower-level users have been granted access to submit specific forms, which is disabled by default."], "published": "2024-12-14T09:15:05.083", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["shabti"], "productName": ["Frontend Admin by DynamiApps"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
