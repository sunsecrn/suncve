The allocated image will then be\npopulated with instructions during the real patch phase. But after\ncommit 26ef208c209a (\"bpf: Use arch_bpf_trampoline_size\"), the `im`\nargument is inconsistent in the dry run and real patch phase. This may\ncause emit_imm in RV64 to generate a different number of instructions\nwhen generating the 'im' address, potentially causing out-of-bounds\nissues. Let's emit the maximum number of instructions for the \"im\"\naddress during dry run to fix this problem."], "published": "2024-08-17T10:15:09.707", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Linux"], "productName": ["Linux"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
