Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the upnpd service, which listens on UDP port 1900 by default. A crafted MX header field in an SSDP message can trigger an overflow of a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.
