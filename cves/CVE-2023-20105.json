An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application as a Read-only user and sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the passwords of any user on the system, including an administrative user, and then impersonate that user.\r\n\r Note: Cisco Expressway Series refers to the Expressway Control (Expressway-C) device and the Expressway Edge (Expressway-E) device."], "published": "2023-06-28T15:15:09.517", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Cisco"], "productName": ["Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) Expressway"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
