Rekor prior to version 1.1.1 may crash due to out of memory (OOM) conditions caused by reading archive metadata files into memory without checking their sizes first. Verification of a JAR file submitted to Rekor can cause an out of memory crash if files within the META-INF directory of the JAR are sufficiently large. Parsing of an APK file submitted to Rekor can cause an out of memory crash if the .SIGN or .PKGINFO files within the APK are sufficiently large. The OOM crash has been patched in Rekor version 1.1.1. There are no known workarounds."], "published": "2023-05-08T16:15:09.453", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["sigstore"], "productName": ["rekor"], "github": {"advisories": ["https://github.com/sigstore/rekor/security/advisories/GHSA-2h5h-59f5-c5x9"], "commits": ["https://github.com/sigstore/rekor/commit/cf42ace82667025fe128f7a50cf6b4cdff51cc48"], "pocAdvisorie": {}, "repo": "https://github.com/sigstore/rekor/", "info": {"exist": true, "topics": ["provenance", "security", "supply-chain", "transparency-log"], "langs": {"Go": 1265893, "Shell": 84810, "Makefile": 11121, "HCL": 4527, "Dockerfile": 1958, "Gnuplot": 1355, "Standard ML": 524}, "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71096353?v=4", "stargazers": 944, "language": "Go"}}, "pocList": []}
