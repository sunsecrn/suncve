Due to an integer overflow with regards to this calculation, this can result in an undersized heap buffer being allocated. When this heap buffer is written to, a heap-based buffer overflow will occur. This can result in code execution under the context of the application."], "published": "2021-12-22T19:15:11.500", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["n/a"], "productName": ["Blackmagic Design"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
