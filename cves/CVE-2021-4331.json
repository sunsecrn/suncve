The plugin adds a registration form to the Elementor page builders functionality. As part of the registration form, users can choose which role to set as the default for users upon registration. This field is not hidden for lower-level users so any user with access to the Elementor page builder, such as contributors, can set the default role to administrator. Since contributors can not publish posts, only author+ users can elevate privileges without interaction via a site administrator (to approve a post)."], "published": "2023-03-07T15:15:10.580", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Unknown", "posimyththemes"], "productName": ["The Plus Addons for Elementor Page Builder", "The Plus Addons for Elementor | FREE Elementor Widgets & Elementor Templates, Header Menu, Blog Post Builder, Dark Mode, Full-Page Scroll, Cross Domain Copy"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
