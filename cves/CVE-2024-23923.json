This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Alpine Halo9 devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the prh_l2_sar_data_ind function. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.\n\nWas ZDI-CAN-22945"], "published": "2024-09-28T07:15:02.440", "state": "PUBLIC", "vendorName": ["Alpine"], "productName": ["Halo9"], "github": {"advisories": [], "commits": [], "pocAdvisorie": null, "repo": null, "info": {}}, "pocList": []}
